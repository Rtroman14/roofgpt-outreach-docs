## Overview

The **RoofGPT Email Outreach System** is a one-time, end-to-end implementation for commercial roofing contractors focused on generating qualified leads for their commercial division. We install a complete cold email engine that consistently reaches property owners, decision-makers, and facility managers at scale. The system uses multiple lookalike domains, warmed inboxes, proven messaging frameworks, and automated multi-step campaigns to book inspections and produce qualified commercial opportunities. After implementation, clients own the system outright with no recurring fees.

## Purpose

This documentation is created so that RoofGPT clients can:

-   Understand the components of the outreach system.
-   Learn how to operate the system day-to-day without needing live support.
-   Configure and add new email domains as needed.
-   Troubleshoot deliverability, campaign performance, and inbox management.
-   Reference best practices for prospecting, outreach cadence, and compliance.

## Key Features of the Implementation

1. **Domain Setup & Warmup**

    - Purchase lookalike sending domains to protect the client’s primary domain reputation.
    - Provision Google Workspace accounts for all new domains.
    - Configure DNS (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for each domain to ensure authentication and deliverability.
    - Warm new inboxes for ~3–4 weeks before any production sending.

2. **Email Infrastructure**

    - Dedicated inboxes for outreach campaigns.
    - Forwarding and lead-routing rules to ensure responses reach the right sales reps.

3. **Instantly Configuration & Campaigns**

    - Connect all new inboxes to Instantly for warmup and campaign management.
    - Implement A/B testing for subject lines and email bodies.
    - Define daily sending limits, spacing, and ramp schedules aligned to warmup status.
    - Provide best practices for copywriting, personalization, and follow-up cadence.
    - Maintain sequence libraries optimized for commercial roofing.

4. **Prospect Database (Airtable)**

    - Airtable base for storing prospects, responses, and campaign metadata.
    - Example fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Street, City, State, Zip, Building Type, Year Built, Status, Tag, Source, Follow-up Date, Response, Response Date.
    - Dashboard views and reports (KPIs, response rates, positive replies, booked meetings).

5. **Automations & Data Quality**

    - NeverBounce (or equivalent) to validate emails on ingest.
    - AI agent to classify inbound replies (e.g., Positive, Referral, Not Interested, OOO).
    - Automations to assign validated prospects to the correct Instantly campaign.

6. **Lead Sources & Scraping**

    - Initial source: Reonomy. User provides a Reonomy list link; scraper ingests prospects into Airtable.
    - Planned expansion to additional sources over time.

7. **Training, Analytics & Ownership**

    - Campaign analytics surfaced in Airtable dashboards.
    - Clients receive full system ownership post-implementation.
    - Documentation provides step-by-step guidance for future adjustments and scaling.

## Implementation Flow (High-level)

1. Purchase lookalike domains; set up Google Workspace accounts.
2. Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for each domain.
3. Connect inboxes to Instantly and start warmup (3–4 weeks).
4. Build and enable A/B-tested sequences with conservative sending limits during warmup.
5. Set up Airtable base, tables, and views; enable dashboards.
6. Configure automations: NeverBounce validation, AI reply classification, and campaign assignment.
7. Add lead sources (begin with Reonomy link); scraper loads prospects to Airtable.
8. As campaigns run, all replies are logged in Airtable, classified by AI, and routed to sales.

## Deliverables

-   Fully configured cold email outreach system within **5 business days**.
-   Lookalike domains, Google Workspace inboxes, and DNS (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) configured.
-   Instantly workspace with connected warmed inboxes and A/B-tested campaign sequences.
-   Airtable base with tables, views, dashboards, and automations (NeverBounce, AI classification, campaign routing).
-   Reonomy ingestion workflow and scraper configured to load Airtable automatically.
-   Documentation portal with best practices for copy, sending limits, and maintenance.
-   Training on domain management, sequences, dashboards, and interpreting results.
-   Optional monthly management services available if client prefers hands-off execution.

## Value Proposition

The RoofGPT Email Outreach System eliminates reliance on storm events, referrals, or paid ads by creating a **predictable, repeatable pipeline** for commercial roofers. With one successful commercial job often worth \$25k+, the system can pay for itself with a single deal. Roofers gain a long-term asset they own and control, rather than renting leads from agencies or directories.
