    </Step>

    <Step title="Scraping and validation (automated)">
        Once your Reonomy URL is added, the backend system will:
        - Scrape all properties from your Reonomy link
        - Populate the **Contacts**, **Properties**, and **Property Owners** tables
        - Automatically validate email addresses using NeverBounce
        - Update contact Status to **Validated Emails** for valid addresses

                alt="Contacts table showing validated records"
            />
        </Frame>

        <Note>
            This process is handled automatically. Contact support if you don't see contacts appear
            within 24 hours.
        </Note>

        <Check>Contacts appear in the Validated Emails view with valid email addresses.</Check>

    <Step title="Assign contacts to campaign">
        - Open Instantly and navigate to your campaign.
        - Copy the **campaign ID** from the URL bar.

            />
        </Frame>

        - Navigate to the **Campaigns** table in Airtable.

        - Update the **Campaign** column for contacts to point to your campaign.
