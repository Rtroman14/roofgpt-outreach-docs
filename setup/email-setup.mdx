description: "Buy lookalike domains, create inboxes, and add SPF/DKIM/DMARC."

<Info>Goal: authenticated inboxes ready for sending.</Info>

## Prerequisites

-   Access to your domain registrar
-   Google Workspace admin access
-   [Instantly Outreach Hypergrowth Plan](https://instantly.ai/?via=roofgpt)

<Steps>
<Step title="Buy lookalike domains">
    - Choose at least 2 domains that resemble your main brand.
    - If your main domain is `acmeroofing.com`, examples: `acmeroof.com`, `acmeroofs.com`.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Google Workspace inboxes">
    - Purchase 2–3 Google Workspace user licenses per domain at [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/business/signup/welcome).
    - Create 2–3 email addresses per domain (e.g., `first@domain` and `first.last@domain`).

</Step>

<Step title="Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records">
  - Add SPF TXT record (include Google):

```txt
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

<Note>
    You can only have one SPF record per domain. If you already have an SPF record, merge the Google
    include into your existing record.
</Note>

-   Add DMARC policy at `_dmarc`:

```txt
Type: TXT
Name: _dmarc
Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; adkim=r; aspf=r; rua=mailto:your-email@domain.com;
```

<Note>
    Replace `your-email@domain.com` with your actual email address where you want to receive DMARC
    reports.

-   Generate and publish DKIM from Google Admin:

    1. Visit [Google Admin](https://admin.google.com/ac/home?hl=en):
    2. Go to Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Authenticate email
    3. Generate a new record. Set **Select DKIM key bit length** to `2048` and **Prefix selector (optional)** to `google`
    4. Add the new DNS record at your registrar/DNS host
    5. Click Start authenticating in Google Admin

-   DKIM DNS record (add the value provided by Google Admin):

```txt
Type: TXT
Name: google._domainkey
Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=... <-- (DKIM generated by Google Admin)
```

<Step title="Enable domain forwarding">
- Go to your domain registrar for each lookalike domain.
- Open domain forwarding and forward the lookalike domain to your main domain (e.g., `acmeroof.com` -> `acmeroofing.com`).
- Set **Forward Type** to `Permanent (301)`. - Save and test by visiting the lookalike domain; it should redirect to your main domain.
