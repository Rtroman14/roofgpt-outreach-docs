    <br />
    Hi `firstName`,
    <br />
    <br />
    I’m reaching out about your building at `address`.
    <br />
    <br />
    We’re offering a complimentary **15-point roof inspection report** for select commercial properties
    this month.
    <br />
    <br />
    The report includes: <br />
    1. Drone & on-roof photos <br />
    2. Condition grade and remaining service life estimate <br />
    3. Priority repair recommendations ranked by urgency
    <br />
    Would you like me to reserve an inspection slot for `address`?

<Expandable title="Email 2 — Quick bump">
    `firstName`, just circling back on the 15-point inspection offer.
    <br />
    <br />
    We only have a handful of inspection slots left this month.
    <br />
    <br />
    Should I hold one for `address`?

<Expandable title="Email 3 — Added value">
    Along with the report, we can include a budget forecast worksheet showing projected roof costs
    for the next 5 years.
    <br />
    <br />
    Want me to add that to your inspection for `address`?

<Expandable title="Email 4 — Soft break">
    Hi `firstName`,
    <br />
    <br />
    Haven’t heard back, so I’ll assume timing isn’t ideal. If you’d like the 15-point inspection later,
    just reply and I’ll schedule it.
    <br />
    <br />
    Okay to close the file for now?

### Template B — Energy efficiency / cool roofs

<Expandable title="Email 1 — Intro">
    <br />
    `firstName`, quick one — have you looked at cool roof options for `property`? We’re seeing measurable
    energy savings on similar buildings.
    <br />
    <br />
    Worth a quick look?
    <br />
    <br />

<Expandable title="Email 2 — Proof">
    <br />
    Similar sites in `city` cut peak cooling load 10–15% after maintenance + coating.

    Open to a short comparison?

<Expandable title="Email 3 — Offer value">
    <br />

<Expandable title="Email 1 — Roof tune‑up for address">
    <br />
    Hi `firstName`,
    <br />
    <br />
    I’m reaching out about your building at `address`.
    <br />
    <br />
    We’re offering a complimentary roof tune‑up program for select commercial properties this
    month.
    <br />
    <br />
    Here’s what the tune‑up includes: <br />
    1. Light repairs (drain cleaning, seam sealing)
    2. Full inspection with a written grade for your
    records
    3. Photo package for your files
    4. If needed, a no‑obligation repair estimate

    Would you like me to hold a spot for `address`?

<Expandable title="Email 2 — Quick follow‑up">
    `firstName`, did you see my last email?
    <br />
    <br />
    We’re only doing a handful of these tune‑ups.
    <br />
    <br />
    Should I reserve a slot for `address` this month?

<Expandable title="Email 3 — Social proof">
    We recently completed this program for a commercial building in `city`.
    <br />
    <br />
    They avoided a costly emergency repair thanks to a minor issue we caught.
    <br />
    <br />
    Would you like me to prepare the same tune‑up for `address`?

<Expandable title="Email 4 — Soft break">
    Hi `firstName`,
    <br />
    <br />
    Since I haven’t heard back, I’ll assume this isn’t a priority right now. If things change, just reply
    and I’ll make sure `address` is scheduled.
    <br />
