description: "Battle‑tested subject line patterns to A/B test across audiences."
---

<Info>Keep subjects short, natural case, no emojis, no sales words.</Info>

## Patterns to test

-   Personalized: `` firstName`, quick question` | `Question about `property ``
-   Short: `roof plan?` | `winter prep` | ``firstName`, quick one`
-   Connection: `Found you via `source`` | `Working with managers in `city``
-   Curiosity: ``firstName`, odd question`|`quick roof note`
-   Useful: `reduce roof costs` | `prevent leak season`

## Safety checks

-   Avoid ALL CAPS, punctuation spam, and words like “free/discount/sale”
-   Do not use links or tracking in Email 1
-   Test one variable at a time and let each run to 50–100 sends

## Length & personalization

-   Aim for ~30–50 characters so it fits on mobile
-   Use light tokens where available: `firstName`, `address`, `company`, `city`
-   Focus on an outcome or pain (e.g., leak prevention, winter prep)
