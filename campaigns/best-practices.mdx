## Overview

Use these practices to design sequences that get replies without harming deliverability.

<Tip>Aim for clear value, short emails, and consistent follow-ups. Personalize where possible.</Tip>

## Sequence structure

-   4–6 total touches over 21–28 days
-   Plain text only; disable open tracking
-   Single CTA per email; avoid links in the first touch
-   Keep body to 3–6 short sentences
-   Length targets: Email 1 ≈ 75–150 words; follow-ups 30–90 words

## Copy guidelines

-   Subject lines: 2–8 words, lowercase, no spammy terms
-   First line: why you’re reaching out to them specifically
-   Value prop: inspection, proactive maintenance, or cost-avoidance angle
-   CTA: one simple question (e.g., “Worth a quick look next week?”)

## A/B testing

-   Test subject lines and first sentences first
-   Keep one variable per test
-   Let tests run to at least 50–100 sends per variant

## Scheduling

-   Send during business hours in recipient time zones
-   Skip holidays; space touches 3–5 business days apart
-   Send follow-ups as replies in the same thread for context

## When to launch

<Warning>
    Only launch after inboxes have warmed for 3–4 weeks and domain authentication passes.
</Warning>
