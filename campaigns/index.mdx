## Overview

Use this section to create high-performing campaigns for commercial property owners, facility managers, and decision‑makers. You will plan an offer, write short plain‑text emails, configure A/B tests in Instantly, and scale safely without hurting deliverability.

<Tip>Strong offer > strong copy. Keep it short, plain‑text, and personal.</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Define your offer and ideal contacts">
  - Pick one clear outcome (inspection, maintenance plan, leak prevention, energy savings)
  - Target decision‑makers (owner, asset manager, facilities, property manager)
  <Check>You can describe your offer in one sentence for one persona.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Draft a 4-email sequence">
    - Keep each email 3–6 short sentences - Use a single low‑friction CTA (e.g., "Worth a quick
    look?") - No links or images in Email 1
    <Check>Sequence kept to plain‑text with one CTA per email.</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Set up variants in Instantly">
    - A/B test subject lines and first sentences first - Limit to one variable per test - Send only
    during business hours in recipient time zones
    <Warning>Do not enable open tracking; it harms deliverability.</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="QA and launch">
  - Proofread for spam words and hidden formatting
  - Verify sending caps and warmup health for all inboxes
  - Send a live test to yourself and one colleague
  <Check>All tests pass; sequence status is scheduled.</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>
