description: "How to launch sequences safely and scale volume without hurting deliverability."

## Launch schedule

-   Day 1: 5 cold emails/day
-   Day 5: 10/day
-   Day 10: 15/day
-   Day 15: 20/day
-   Day 20: 25 cold + 25 warmup = 50/day

## Rules

1. Never exceed 50/day/account
2. Increase gradually; only scale if open rate healthy and warmup ≥ 98%
3. If results dip → pause cold for 1–2 weeks and run warmup only
4. Add new domains/accounts to scale beyond 50/day

## Pre‑flight checklist (before launch)

-   ✅ SPF, DKIM, DMARC passing
-   ✅ Inboxes warmed ≥ 2 weeks (prefer 3–4)
-   ✅ Lead list verified (bounces < 2%)
-   ✅ Tracking domain owned and warmed (if using tracking)
-   ✅ Sending domains point to a real website

## Daily volumes and ratios

-   Keep ~50 total emails per account/day (includes warmup)
-   Start 25 cold + 25 warmup
-   Adjust ratio based on deliverability:
    -   If performance drops → 15 cold / 35 warmup or pause cold for 1–2 weeks
    -   If strong → 30 cold / 20 warmup and reassess

## Deliverability guardrails

### Do this

-   Plain‑text emails; avoid images and links in Email 1
-   Rotate inboxes; keep 3–5 inboxes per domain
-   Disable open tracking; focus on replies and meetings
-   Use light spintax to vary phrasing (avoid heavy templating)
-   Run frequent checks with tools like Glockapps

### Avoid this

-   Spam trigger words and emoji spam
-   Over‑sending (> 50/day/account)
-   Unverified lists (bounces ≥ 3%)
-   Copy‑pasted rich text with hidden HTML

### Metrics to monitor

-   Reply rate, positive replies, meetings booked, revenue
-   Bounce rate < 2%
-   Warmup health ≥ 98%
