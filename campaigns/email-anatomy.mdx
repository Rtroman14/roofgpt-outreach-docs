## Three essentials

1. **Personalization** — Show why you’re reaching out to them specifically.
2. **Offer** — Present a clear outcome they care about (inspection, cost‑avoidance, maintenance).
3. **CTA** — Ask one simple, low‑friction question.

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Personalization examples">
    - Compliment: recent deal, new property, promotion, community involvement
    - Context: building type, city, weather risk, energy savings
    - First‑line ideas: “Noticed the roof area at `property` …”
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Offer guidance">
    - Strong offer beats clever copy
    - Be specific (prevent leaks this season; extend roof life 3–5 years)
    - Avoid links and attachments in Email 1
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="CTA examples">
    - “Mind if I send more info?”
    - “Worth a quick look next week?”
    - “Open to a quick second opinion on your roof plan?”
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Follow-up framework

Limit to 3-5 emails with 2-3 days between emails:

1. Intro with relevance and question
2. Social proof or similar buildings
3. Value email (checklist/score) without links
4. Soft break / permission to close the loop

<Tip>Plain text only. Keep 3–6 short sentences per email.</Tip>
